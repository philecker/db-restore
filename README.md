This is a shell script for simplifying a database restore from backup file using PostgreSQL. Here's how it works:

1. The script gets today's date and sets a default file name and database name based on that date.
2. It prompts the user to confirm whether to drop and recreate the database or use the default database name.
3. It drops and recreates the database using the chosen or default database name.
4. It prompts the user to enter the backup file name or use the default file name.
5. It restores the database using the chosen or default backup file name.
6. It prints a message indicating that the restore process is complete.

To use this script, you can save it to a file with a .sh extension, make it executable using the command "chmod +x filename.sh", and then run it from the command line using "./filename.sh". Make sure to replace "your_file_name" and "your_database_name" with your own backup file name and database name. Also, make sure that the backup file is located in the Downloads folder of your home directory.
